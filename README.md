# Do Financial and Macroeconomic Features Predict Equity Crowdfunding Outcomes?

## Objective
Using a range of ML models applied to Reg CF Form C dataset, the objective of this study is to evaluate and compare whether theoretically grounded financial and macroeconomic information adds predictive value beyond basic crowdfunding characteristics; thereby providing insights into the role of these feature groups in shaping investor decision-making in equity CF.

## Target Variable
The target variable represents the CF outcome, where 1 and 0 are used to indicate successful and failed CF offering, respectively. A successful offering is defined as offerings that are able to reach or exceed the offering target before or at the offering deadline. Otherwise, the offering is classified as a failure. This definition is used because CF offerings under Reg CF are all under the All-or-Nothing model.

## Feature Selection
Feature selection will be taking on literature review approach to ensure that the selected variables are grounded in established theoretical and empirical findings. This approach reduces the risk of including irrelevant or spurious predictors.

## Feature Transformation and Scaling
For Boolean features, no transformation or scaling is applied. Categorical features are transformed using one-hot encoding, which converts each category into a separate binary column. Finally, numerical features, by contrast, are first transformed and then scaled to address skewness and heavy-tailed distributions, which can distort model performance, particularly in distance-based algorithms such as K-means, which will later be used for clustering.

Numerical features are transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine (arcsinh) function. The arcsinh transformation is chosen because of its favorable characteristics. First, it is defined at zero (with arcsinh(0) = 0). Second, it behaves almost linearly near zero, which is especially useful when dealing with ratios, such as the debt-to-asset ratio, where the numerators are typically smaller than the denominator. Third, arcsinh compresses extreme positive and negative values, reducing the impact of extreme outliers. Lastly, it is odd symmetrical around the origin (i.e. arcsinh(-x) = - arcsinh(x)), making it robust when handling features that can take both positive or negative value.

Next, numerical features are scaled using Robust Scaling, as shown in the formula below. This method is well-suited for handling outliers, as it centers the data using the median and scales it based on the interquartile range (IQR). By doing so, it preserves the relative differences within the central portion of the data distribution while minimizing the influence of extreme values.

## Clustering Result

A feature will be generated that categorizes the issuers into their appropriate development stage. But rather than classifying them using hand-made rules, non-supervised ML model, namely K-mean clustering and hierarchical clustering, will be deployed. These two models use different assumptions and provide different perspectives. K-Means assumes that clusters are spherical. It is most optimal when all clusters have similar spread/variance and are equally sized (in terms of the number of data points). In contrast, hierarchical clustering makes no assumptions related to the shape of the clusters. It can capture more complex structures, e.g. it can reveal nested structures (such as a “scaling” group that further subdivides into “efficient scaling” and “strained scaling”), reflecting the reality that development phase is continuum, not just isolated blobs.
Note that the clustering process will only be using features that directly capture a company’s maturity and financial profile. The selected features include,
- Revenue: It is a primary indicator of a company’s operational activity. It helps distinguish between pre-revenue and post-revenue companies, and higher revenue levels generally indicate greater market traction and operational scale.
- Revenue Growth: This metric captures the trajectory of the company. A high growth rate suggests that the firm is in an active scaling phase. 
-	Net Profit Margin and Gross Profit Margin: These profitability metrics are crucial for understanding operational efficiency and sustainability. Gross profit margin reflects how efficiently a company produces its goods or services, while net profit margin accounts for all expenses. Early-stage firms often exhibit negative margins due to reinvestment and development costs, whereas later-stage firms may show improved margins.
-	Total Asset and Number of Employees: These serve as proxies for the scale and complexity of the business. It helps to differentiate between lean startups and well-resourced companies.
-	Company Age: Younger companies are more likely to be in the pre-revenue or growth phase, while older firms are more likely to have an established position in the market.
